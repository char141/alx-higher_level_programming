# Python - Input/Output
ALX project done to facilitate completion of Full Stack Software Engineering course.

# Learning Objective
* Opening, writing, reading, closing a file
* How to use `with` statement
* JSON
* Serialization and deserialization
* Conversion of Python data structure to JSON string and vise versa

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* The Python files have strictly followed [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) coding and documentation styles.
